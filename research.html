<img src="images/line.png" alt="Horizontal Line" class="line-image">
    <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;"> My research focuses on intelligent sensing and WiFi sensing (associated with <a style="color:blue; "href="https://wisecomlab.github.io/">WiSeComLab</a>),
	    exploring the integration of advanced sensor technologies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) concentration on 
	    Machine Learning (ML) to enhance data collection, analysis, and prediction. 
	    Specifically, I investigate how WiFi signals can be used for non-intrusive monitoring of environments 
	    and activities. In recent years wifi sensing has been an emerging area of research. 
	    Wifi signals (Radio Frequency Signals) are ubiquitous and non-intrusive, 
	    they can be used to track or detect the movement of objects through the wall i.e. called through wall sensing.  
	    By analyzing variations in WiFi signal patterns, my work aims to develop accurate and
	    efficient methods for detecting human presence, movements, and even specific gestures without the
	    need for wearable devices. This research has significant implications for smart homes, healthcare, and security 
	    applications, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time monitoring and automation.</p>

  <h2  style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size: 20px;">Intelligent Sensing: </h2>
  <img src="images/line.png" alt="Horizontal Line" class="line-image">

	   efficiency but also opens new avenues for innovation and smarter solutions in numerous domains.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size: 20px;"> Intelligent Non-contact Ultrasonic Sensor:</h2>
<img src="images/line.png" alt="Horizontal Line" class="line-image">
   <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;"> Intelligent sensing using non-contact ultrasonic sensors
	   is an innovative approach that combines the precision of ultrasonic technology with the power of 
	   artificial intelligence  to create highly efficient and versatile sensing systems. 
	   Non-contact ultrasonic sensors use high-frequency sound waves to detect objects and measure
	   distances without physical contact, making them ideal for applications where traditional contact-based 
	   methods are impractical or could cause damage. By integrating AI, these sensors can analyze the 
	   reflected sound waves in real-time, distinguishing between different materials, shapes, and sizes with high accuracy.
	   This intelligent processing capability enhances applications such as robotic navigation, industrial automation, 
	   and environmental monitoring by providing precise, reliable data even in challenging conditions like dust,
	   smoke, or varying lighting. The fusion of AI with ultrasonic sensing not only improves performance but
	   also enables the development of smarter, adaptive systems that can learn and improve over time, driving 
	   advancements in technology and operational efficiency across various sectors.</p>
 
   <h2 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size: 20px;">Device Free WiFi Sensing (DFWS):</h2>
   <img src="images/line.png" alt="Horizontal Line" class="line-image">
	<p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">Device Free WiFi Sensing (DFWS) sensing are innovative techniques that leverage wireless signals to detect and monitor various activities and 
		environmental changes without relying on traditional sensors or direct interaction with devices.

<h3>WiFi Sensing:</h3> <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;"> Utilizes existing WiFi signals to sense changes in the environment.
	    By analyzing the way WiFi signals are altered by the presence and movement of objects and people, 
	    this technology can detect activities, track movements, and even recognize gestures.
	    This approach takes advantage of the ubiquitous presence of WiFi networks, making it a cost-effective and 
	    scalable solution for applications like home security, elderly care, and smart home automation.
	    WiFi sensing can monitor occupancy, detect falls, and provide insights into the usage patterns of
	    different spaces, all without requiring users to carry or interact with specific devices.</p>

<h3>Device-Free Sensing:</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">Device-free sensing, as the name suggests, involves monitoring and detecting activities or changes
	    in the environment without requiring individuals to carry any specific device. 
	    This method often uses passive sensors, such as cameras, microphones, or ambient sensors, 
	    and leverages signal processing and AI to interpret the data. Device-free sensing is valuable in 
	    scenarios where wearing or carrying a device is impractical, such as in surveillance, elderly care, 
	    and public safety. By analyzing patterns and anomalies in the data collected from the environment, 
	    these systems can provide valuable insights and trigger alerts for various events, such as intrusions,
	    health emergencies, or environmental changes.</p>

	and interact with the world around us in a more seamless and efficient manner.</p>
	    
	<h2 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size: 20px;">Sound Signal (Ultrasonic Signal):</h2> 
	<img src="images/line.png" alt="Horizontal Line" class="line-image">
	    <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">Sound signalsare waves of pressure that required a physical
		    medium, such as air, water, or solid materials, to propagate and are within the audible frequency range of human hearing, 
		    typically from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Sound signals are used in various applications, including communication (speech and music), 
		    sonar, and audio recording. They are easily affected by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and obstacles,
		    which can absorb, reflect, or scatter the sound waves. 
		    
		    <strong>Ultrasonic Signals</strong> are sound waves with frequencies above the audible range of human hearing, typically above 20 kHz. These high-frequency waves are used in 
		    various applications such as medical imaging (ultrasound), industrial non-destructive testing, distance measurement, 
		    and object detection. Ultrasonic signals travel through the same mediums as audible sound but have shorter wavelengths, 
		    which allow them to detect smaller objects and provide more detailed information. </p>
	    
       <h2 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size: 20px;">RF Signal vs Sound Signal:</h2>
	   <img src="images/line.png" alt="Horizontal Line" class="line-image">
	     <ul>
		     <li><p></p><strong>Medium Requirement:</strong> Ultrasonic signals need a physical medium to travel, limiting their use in certain environments like a vacuum. 
			RF signals do not require a medium, allowing them to propagate through a vacuum and various materials.</p></li>
		     <li><p></p><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Ultrasonic signal performance can be affected by the medium's properties such as temperature, humidity (moisture)
			  and other parameters present in air, while RF signals are less affected but can experience attenuation due to interference.</p></li>
		     <li><p></p><strong>Application Versatility:</strong> RF signals' ability to travel through different materials and long distances makes them suitable for a broader
			     range of applications, from communication to remote sensing, whereas ultrasonic signals are more specialized for short-range, precise measurements in specific media.</p></li>
